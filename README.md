# Baseball Rougelite Game Prototype

Prototype for a baseball card playing game.

## Mechanics
- Play cards on your turn to advance or score runners.
- Play cards on the opponent's turn to prevent runs from scoring.
- If you win a game, get card upgrades to improve your cards (e.g. Base Hit -> Double)
    - This helps because the game difficulty scales over time.
